# CONNECT TO FRONTEND TO BACKEND

This repository demonstrates a simple web application that connects the frontend and backend. The project uses Express.js for the server, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose for object modeling. The frontend is a basic HTML form to collect user details, and the backend saves this data to the MongoDB database.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/connect-back-to-front.git
   cd connect-back-to-front
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server will be running on http://localhost:4040.

## Project Structure

- **`app.js`**: Main server file where the Express application is defined.
- **`model.js`**: Mongoose schema definition for user details.
- **`database.js`**: Connection to the MongoDB database.
- **`index.html`**: Simple HTML form for collecting user details.

## Dependencies

- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Mongoose**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- **Body-Parser**: Node.js body parsing middleware.

## Configuration

- **MongoDB URI**: The MongoDB connection URI is stored in the `DB_URI` variable in `database.js`. Update this URI with your own MongoDB database connection string.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser: http://localhost:4040.
2. Fill in the first name and last name in the form.
3. Click the "Save User" button to submit the form.
4. The user details will be saved to the MongoDB database.
